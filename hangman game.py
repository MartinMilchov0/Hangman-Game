rules = '''Welcome to Hangman! Your goal is to guess a hidden word either by guessing individual 
letters in the word or the entire word.
You have 5 health at the start and everytime you guess a letter incorrectly you lose 1 health.
But if you try to guess the entire word and dont get it right, you lose all your health at once.
If you reach 0 health, you lose the game.
You can choose the category of your word from 4 options - Fruits, Vegetables, Animals & School
and you also get a score based on how well you perform(1 health = 100 points).
Good luck and have fun!'''
